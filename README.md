# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
This work day scheduler was created as a teacher with a busy schedule. I wanted to add important events to a daily planner so that I could manage my time effectively. While creating this project, I learned how to display the current day and time using DayJS. I also learned how to add in more time blocks and color code them based on the current time. If the hour has passed, the time block will turn red. If it is the current hour, the time block is grey. Hours in the future appear green in the time blocks. I was able to have the important events saved in local storage and I learned how to save the events, even when the page refreshes.
